## Q1) Write a program that prompts the user to input a year, checks whether it's a leap year or not, and then prints the result.
# while True:    
#     raw = input("Enter the Year to check:")
#     year = int(raw)
#     if year % 4 == 0:
#         print("Year:", year)
#         print("Leap Year:", "Yes")
#     else:
#         print("Year:", year)
#         print("Leap Year:", "No")


## Q2) Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a word. The program should then determine and output the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the provided word. Additionally, consider that the word can be in either uppercase or lowercase.
# word = input("Please enter a word:")
# check = word.lower()
# count = 0
# vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
# for i in check:
#     if i in vowels:
#         count = count + 1
# print("No. of vowels in given word:", count)
