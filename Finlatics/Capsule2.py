# Q1) Write a program that prompts the user to input a year, checks whether it's a leap year or not, and then prints the result.
# while True:    
#     raw = input("Enter the Year to check:")
#     year = int(raw)
#     if year % 4 == 0:
#         print("Year:", year)
#         print("Leap Year:", "Yes")
#     else:
#         print("Year:", year)
#         print("Leap Year:", "No")
